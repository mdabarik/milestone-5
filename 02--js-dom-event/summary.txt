What are events?

some important event:
onclick, onchange, onmouseover, onkeydown, onload, onblur

2 ways of handling js events?
1. by using an event handler
2. by adding event listener

event handler (function/callback function)
addEventListener, target, type, callback function


Event bubbling
Event stop propagation
stop immediate propagation

Event delegate (delegation):
Event delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently.
Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, 
we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an even on 
a particular target using the target property of the event object.
